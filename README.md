# Tableau Portfolio

## Why did I create this repository?
This repository displays a few of the dashboards that I've created using free datasets availbale online from reputable data warehouses. These dashboards were made specifically for this portfolio to display my experiences working with the program. Tableau is the market choice when it comes to data visualization and is a key skill that anyone handling data and data management should have basic knowledge of. I enjoy the challenges that come with working within Tableau and always find myself learning something new every time I use it. With a community as large and helpful as Tableau, it's hard not to favor it. 

## Why did I choose Tableau?

* Industry Standard
* Ease of use for the end user
* Large community base that offers endless support when needed
